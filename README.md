Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find my name and a recent photo.

There are three main areas of content which include a short bio about me, a showcase of my projects, and a contact section. There is working navigation at the top of the page that will bring you to the corresponding section when clicked.

In the projects section you will find applications I've developed. I have featured my best work as the largest image. If you click the image it will act as a link that will take you to the deployed website.

I have used a flexboxes in multiple areas to ensure that content is placed where I want it to belong on the page.

I used both flex display and a media query on my hero banner to ensure a responsive layout. The media query ensures that the hero banner stays a full banner even as the screen width gets smaller. As a result the user is presented first with my name, then navigation, then a full width banner so that it is intuitive and easy to read even on a smaller device.
